      <p>This page contains several section about radio usage and help. Please check the menu for the different sections.</p>
      <p>To use the radio fully you will have to obtain an API key. This can be achieved via the <em>miku</em> bot that sits on the #radio IRC channel (but can be reached over private message too). You will have to associate your nick first (after authenticating via <em>Satsuki</em>). Check <a href="#associate">.associate</a> for more details.</p>
      <p>Make sure to read the <a href="#privacy">Privacy considerations</a> section to learn how we handle your data.</p>
      <h1 id="stream-information">Stream information</h1>
      <p>You can use the Web site to playback and control the radio. Alternatively, you can use these direct links to use your preferred playback application.</p>
      <p>If you want to list yourself as a listener, you can use one of your API keys for identifying. For example: <code>https://radio.animebits.moe/stream/stream128.ogg?<b>apikey=AbCdEfGhI_0-123456789</b></code>.</p>
      <p>If the place where you connect from blocks multimedia, you can try to add <em>bypass/</em> to the url like this: <code>https://radio.animebits.moe/stream/<b>bypass/</b>stream128.ogg</code>. This will change the Content Type to text which bypasses some company proxies.</p>
      <p>Links are only available under HTTPs. Some bitrates/formats have higher delay than others.</p>

      <p>Note that the streamer will take the original media and convert it realtime to the streamed codec. Most existing media is at least FLAC-16bit, although some are only available in lossy format.</br>When this media played, a transcode will occur. If streaming the FLAC link, an upconversion will occur so you might notice different quality compared to other songs.</p>
      <h1 id="radio-commands">#radio miku bot Help & Commands</h1>
      <p>You can use <em>miku</em> over the #radio channel or via private message. Some queue-related commands might be limited to channel only.</p>
      <p>By default, all users identified via <em>Satsuki</em> have standard rights. If you are not identified, ask in the channel to be granted rights. There are higher right levels for moderation purposes that have extra abilities or commands, those are not listed here.</p>
      <p>If you want to identify and secure your nick, you will have to run <a href="#associate">.associate </a> then <a href="#genkey">.genkey </a> to get an API key.</p>
      <h2 id="skip">.skip</h2>
      <p>Skips the currently playing track. If you are the only listener on the radio, you should have a control on the web interface to do this as well. Only works in channel.</p>
      <h2 id="np">.np</h2>
      <p>Shows the track that is now playing</p>
      <h2 id="listeners-.l">.listeners, .l</h2>
      <p>Shows the current listeners</p>
      <h2 id="queue">.queue, .q</h2>

      <h2 id="top">.top [day|week|month] [player]</h2>
      <p>Shows the top#6 tracks from the last week/month/day, or a player link with the top 20 if specified.</p>
      <h2 id="qpop">.qpop</h2>
      <p>Removes the last entry in the queue. Only works in channel.</p>
      <h2 id="qshift">.qshift</h2>
      <p>Removes the first entry in the queue. Only works in channel.</p>
      <h2 id="favorite-.fav">.favorite [hash], .fav [hash]</h2>
      <p>Favorites the now playing track. If <code>[hash]</code> is specified, favorite that track instead. If you have a different radio nick than your IRC nick, please use <code>.associate</code> first</p>
      <h2 id="unfavorite">.unfavorite [hash], .unfav [hash]</h2>
      <p>Unfavorites the now playing track. If <code>[hash]</code> is specified, unfavorite that track instead. If you have a different radio nick than your IRC nick, please use <code>.associate</code> first</p>
      <h2 id="associate">.associate &lt;nick&gt;</h2>
      <p>Associates radio <code>&lt;nick&gt;</code> with your IRC nick for favorite-related commands and authentication. You need to be authed via Satsuki. Check <a href="#genkey">.genkey</a> to learn how to create an API key afterwards.</p>
      <h2 id="nick">.nick &lt;nick&gt;</h2>
      <p>Changes radio nick to <code>&lt;nick&gt;</code></p>
      <h2 id="unassociate">.unassociate</h2>
      <p>Unassociates radio nick -> IRC nick relation for favorite-related commands. Only works in channel.</p>
      <h2 id="genkey">.genkey &lt;name&gt;</h2>
      <p>Creates or regenerates a new API key that you can use to authenticate on the web interface or the API (put this on an Authorization header when requesting things). You can have multiple API keys, each with a different name. You have to use <a href="#associate">.associate</a> first</p>
      <p>NOTE: This command only works over private message.</p>
      <h2 id="lskeys">.lskeys</h2>
      <p>Lists all of your API keys.</p>
      <p>NOTE: This command only works over private message.</p>
      <h2 id="rmkey">.rmkey &lt;name&gt;</h2>
      <p>Removes one of your API keys.</p>
      <p>NOTE: This command only works over private message.</p>
      <h2 id="search-query-.s-query">.search &lt;query&gt;, .s &lt;query&gt;</h2>
      <p>Does a track search and displays the top three results. You can then send the number (just <code>1</code> or <code>3</code>, or multiple like <code>1,3,5</code>) of the result(s) to queue them. <code>&lt;query&gt;</code> can use multiple selectors (<code>title, album, artist, fav, duration, hash, audio, lyrics, tag, favcount, playcount, tagcount</code>) to reduce the number of results and find the track you want, for example: <code>.search album:"naruto" title:"come back" duration>100</code></p>
      <p>Advanced queries are also supported, using currently playing context (<em>$album</em> or <em>$artist</em>) to refer to current playing track details, quotes, equality operators, or AND / OR / NOT (-) / parenthesis. By default every new term you add uses AND (with higher precedence), but you can specify OR instead (note they must be uppercase).</p>
      <p>For example: <code>favcount>3 (artist=shibayan OR artist="ELECTRO.MUSTER") @mns -"el dorado" #remix</code></p>
      <p>All searches are case insensitive. When using the equality operator, you can include <em>%</em> as a wildcard.</p>
      <p>You can use .more to expand the list of results afterwards. Be nice and do this over private message if you want to go through a lot of them.</p>
      <p>For a more in-depth look at this rich syntax, look at the <a href="https://github.com/WeebDataHoarder/stewdio-api/tree/master/stewdio/search" target="_blank">stewdio-api search code</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="qrand-query">.qrand &lt;query&gt;</h2>
      <p>Does a track search and queues a random result. Same syntax for <code>&lt;query&gt;</code> as <code>.search</code>. Can also specify these commands to queue up to three tracks at once: <code>.qrand1 &lt;query&gt;, .qrand2 &lt;query&gt;, .qrand3 &lt;query&gt;</code></p>
      <h2 id="qfav">.qfav [query]</h2>
      <p>Queues a random favorite. <code>[query]</code> can be specified to limit which favorites to randomly pick, same syntax as for .search. Can also specify these commands to queue up to three tracks at once: <code>.qfav1 [query], .qfav2 [query], .qfav3 [query]</code></p>
      <h2 id="req">.req &lt;query/hash&gt;</h2>
      <p>Same as .search, but if there is only a single result it will queue it directly.</p>
      <h2 id="request">.request &lt;link&gt;</h2>
      <p>Requests an album/artist/collage/series to be added to the radio. Only AnimeBytes / JPopSuki / RED links allowed.</p>
      <h2 id="fetch">.fetch &lt;link&gt;</h2>
      <p>Requests an existing direct media file, pulls metadata out, and tries to find it on the radio. Multiple results displayed.</p>
      <p>Also works with these radio sites (link stream or page directly instead of file): <em>Stewdio Radio System</em>, <em>r/a/dio</em>, <em>edenofthewest</em>, <em>JpopSuki</em>, <em>gensokyoradio</em>, <em>animenfo</em>, <em>listen.moe</em></p>
      <h1 id="information">Out-Of-Band Player</h1>
      <p>The radio has ways to playback your favorited tracks or other queries like albums or single songs without having to put them live on the radio. Most of these require your browser to playback the original file format, but thanks to modern technology we are able to implement JavaScript decoding of most file formats even if your browser does not support them.</p>
      <p>This player also supports timed lyrics on either LRC or ASS format. If you have timed lyrics for any track/album, ask on the IRC channel.</p>
      <p>For any of these links you can append <em>/m3u</em> or <em>/pls</em> to generate a playlist file. It will also work with a dot instead of a forward slash.</p>
      <h2 id="favorites_player">Favorites player</h2>
      <p>You can access your (or other user) favorites using this link format <code>https://radio.animebits.moe/player/favorites/&lt;nick&gt;</code> where &lt;nick&gt; is a valid user nick.</p>
      <h2 id="albumg_player">Album Group player</h2>
      <p>You can list an album(s) using the original group / torrent / series / artist id  from a site. Valid tags are abg (AnimeBytes group id), abt (AnimeBytes torrent id), abs (AnimeBytes series group id), aba (AnimeBytes artist id), jpsg (JPopSuki group id), jpst (JPopSuki torrent id) and others.</p>
      <p>Example: <code>https://radio.animebits.moe/player/abg/8915</code> would link the AnimeBytes group id 8915 (in this format, <em>abg/8915</em>) which corresponds with a final group url like this <code>https://animebytes.tv/torrents2.php?id=8915</code>, which in this case corresponds to Mirage by Mell.</p>
      <h2 id="albumn_player">Album Name player</h2>
      <p>You can list an album(s) using the direct name of it, if you can't find a tagged version of it. Example: <code>https://radio.animebits.moe/player/album/RETRO FUTURE GIRLS</code> where in this case <em>RETRO FUTURE GIRLS</em> is the album name.</p>
      <h2 id="search_player">Search player</h2>
      <p>In case you want to show a longer list or a subset search, you can use this player with any query that works via miku / radio player. Example: <code>https://radio.animebits.moe/player/search/favcount>0 artist=primary</code> where in this case we search for anything with more than 0 favorites from artist equal to primary.</p>
      <h2 id="track_player">Tracklist player</h2>
      <p>In case you want to show a single song or create a small playlist, you pass the song hash(es) as given by miku / API. Example: <code>https://radio.animebits.moe/player/hash/36730236b14c6f715a114845bcb4c373</code> where in this case we find the song Clockup Flowers from MÁGICO CATÁSTROFE.</p>
      <p>Shorter hashes are allowed, or playlists like this <code>https://radio.animebits.moe/player/hash/56e9b1fe,36730236,2aa2cb1b,501b6504,bffe5221,cdd15308,32329b02,b8e84d89,781344a8,1bf36780,45648ccb,c9abfdce,d45d5ab0,8830d4a8,71d06a4b,487c23cf,0b602f46,6f3953d1,5f63e1f3,c7386fa6</code>.</p>

      <h1 id="export-script">Exporting files offline</h1>
      <p>You can write your own tools that use the API to fetch files. Otherwise, we provide a bash script that lets you query the radio database and fetch selected tracks. A use case of this would be exporting your favorites for offline playback. Do note that you are limited to a few number of concurrent connections, and there might be daily limits in the future.</p>
      <p>In doubt, you can use the API to extract tag information, like torrent IDs that you can fetch directly from the original site.</p>
      <p>If you want to use this bash script, you can <a href="https://radio.animebits.moe/radio-downloader.sh" target="_blank">grab radio-downloader.sh over here</a>, and remember to <code>chmod +x radio.downloader.sh</code> afterwards. Do note you will have to edit the file to include an <em>API_KEY</em> on it.</p>
      <p>Some dependencies might need to be installed, in this case <em>curl</em> and <em>jq</em> (JSON command line parser). On Debian/Ubuntu you can install them via <code>sudo apt install curl jq</code>.</p>
      <p>Usage: <code>./radio-downloader.sh &lt;query&gt;</code>, where <em>&lt;query&gt;</em> is any normal search query. It can be set with and without quotes, but remember to escape special characters like <em>&gt; &lt; @ #</em> and similar.</p>
      <p>After running the query, the script will ask you which tracks to fetch. You can configure some settings on the top next to API_KEY, and present your own download path over environment variables. Defaults to current directory.</p>
      <p><figure><img src="/img/script-example.png" alt="An example run of radio-downloader.sh"/><figcaption>An example run of radio-downloader.sh</figcaption></figure></p>

      <h1 id="import-script">Importing favorites</h1>
      <p>You might have a large collection of favorite tracks already. If you want to add these to your radio favorites, we got you covered.</p>
      <p>Head over <a href="https://radio.animebits.moe/import" target="_blank">radio.animebits.moe/import</a> and you can use that to find matches locally without sending any data to the search API except metadata</p>
      <p>You need to be authenticated on main radio page to use this service.</p>

      <h1 id="userscripts">UserScripts</h1>
      <p>Some userscripts are provided that add extra radio functionality to some other related sites.</p>
      <p>You will need an UserScript manager like TamperMonkey, GreaseMonkey, VioletMonkey or similar to use these.</p>
      <p><a href="https://radio.animebits.moe/userscript/animebytes-radio-extensions.user.js" target="_blank">anime(bits) extension for AnimeBytes</a>: Adds several direct album links for player to torrent groups, artists, collages, series, forums with, and other search links for finding related tracks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://radio.animebits.moe/userscript/animebytes-radio-cover.user.js" target="_blank">anime(bits) cover extension for AnimeBytes</a>: Allows finding new covers directly from torrent group, and other utilities to find further data.</p>

      <h1 id="api">API documentation</h1>
      <p>This radio features an extensive API, which is the main way to interact with the radio, and even the landing page uses it. If you don't have an API key, you will be limited to which methods you can use to limit leakage of user data.</p>
      <p><b>The main API URL sits under <code>https://radio.animebits.moe/api/</code>.</b> There is no versioning, and details could change (although usually not in a breaking way). This could change in the future but will be announced on any relevant channels or threads.</p>
      <h2 id="track_record">Track/song record format</h2>
      <p>Anywhere you query or receive song information, you will get back JSON that looks similar to this, depending if you are authenticated or not.</p>
      <p>

      <p>You should familiarize yourself with this format as you will see it everywhere.
        Some details for your handling of this data:
        <ul>
          <li><em>id</em> is an internal field. You will not use it to refer to anything in this API and could change.</li>
          <li><em>hash</em> can be considered your unique identifier. Most endpoints that act or show information on a song will use this to refer to them. This is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5" target="_blank">MD5 digest</a> across the entire file, tags and all. If this hash mathces a file you have, they are the same.</li>
          <li><em>audio_hash</em> is an MD5 digest of raw audio data applied over the decoded audio as signed raw PCM16. This is useful for finding exact audio dupes (with altered metadata).Most endpoints that act or show information on a song will use this to refer to them.</li>
          <li><em>title</em>, <em>album</em> and <em>artist</em> can change when files are tagged or newer metadata is fetched.</li>
          <li><em>path</em> relates to the full storage path the file is stored on. This could change.</li>
          <li><em>cover</em> gets you the album/song cover image.</li>
          <li><em>duration</em> notes the length of the track in seconds. On some files this duration could be corrupt due to bad metadata. If you use it for finding matches, a threshold of 1-2s around this number is recommended for better matching.</li>
          <li><em>status</em> shows whether a track exists on disk / can play or not. Should you find a track not marked active, disregard the record, but it may become active in the future.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
      <p>Unless explicitly said so, assume all API endpoints require authentication. You can obtain any amount of API keys through miku.</p>
      <p>Currently, there are three methods of authenticating, although some are not applicable on some endpoints:
        <ul>
          <li>Via the <em>apikey</em> request URL parameter. Example: <code>https://radio.animebits.moe/api/info/b76f73be23ec611efb77500ad21919a9?<b>apikey=AbCdEfGhI_0-123456789</b></code></li>
          <li>Via the <em>radio-apikey</em> request cookie header. Example: <code>Cookie: <b>radio-apikey=AbCdEfGhI_0-123456789</b></code></li>
          <li>Via the <em>Authorization</em> request header.</br>
            This can be any of these ways of sending it: raw header (example: <code>Authorization: <b>AbCdEfGhI_0-123456789</b></code>), filled username as API key and empty password, or filled password as API key and empty username.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>If denied, you will get a 401 response code. You can generate new keys or remove/regenerate old keys via miku anytime.</p>

      <h2 id="websocket">Realtime WebSocket information</h2>
      <p>If you are interested in live playback or events as they happen, this is the method you should use. Scraping the other API endpoints to check for changes in them is heavily discouraged.</p>
      <p>There are two endpoints, one without authentication and with limited events and fields broadcasted, and other with authentication that contains the full set of events and fields.<p>
      <h3>/events/all</h3>
      <p>Once connected, you will receive an initial dump of information related to the events being listened, then any new changes will be broadcasted directly to you. Every new event sent is JSON-encoded.</p>
      <p>These are the current events being broadcasted. The field <em>type</em> specifies which event you are receiving, while the field <em>data</em> contains the information.
        <ul>
          <li><b>playing</b> gets sent to inform of the current track being played. Contains a <a href="#track_record">song record</a> with some additional fields like play time start.</li>
          <li><b>listeners</b> gets sent to inform of the current number of listeners, and who is listening.</li>
          <li><b>queue</b> gets sent to inform of queue additions / removals. It contains several fields like an <em>action</em> (with values such as initial, add or remove), a <em>queue_id</em>, and a <a href="#track_record">song record</a>. You also receive these when tracks move to next one.</li>
          <li><b>favorite</b> gets sent to inform of players adding or removing tracks to their favorites. It contains an action (with values such as add or remove) and a <a href="#track_record">song record</a>.</li>
          <li><b>random</b> gets sent to inform of the next random track that will be played if queue is empty. Contains a <a href="#track_record">song record</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>/events/basic</h3>
      <p><b>This endpoint does not require authentication.</b></p>
      <p>Once connected, you will receive an initial dump of information related to the events being listened, then any new changes will be broadcasted directly to you. Every new event sent is JSON-encoded.</p>
      <p>These are the current events being broadcasted. They have been cleaned of favorites, path, tags and other identifying information. The field <em>type</em> specifies which event you are receiving, while the field <em>data</em> contains the information.
        <ul>
          <li><b>playing</b> gets sent to inform of the current track being played. Contains a <a href="#track_record">song record</a> with some additional fields like play time start.</li>
          <li><b>listeners</b> gets sent to inform of the current number of listeners.</li>
          <li><b>queue</b> gets sent to inform of queue additions / removals. It contains several fields like an <em>action</em> (with values such as initial, add or remove), a <em>queue_id</em>, and a <a href="#track_record">song record</a>. You also receive these when tracks move to next one.</li>
          <li><b>random</b> gets sent to inform of the next random track that will be played if queue is empty. Contains a <a href="#track_record">song record</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h1 id="privacy">Privacy considerations</h1>
      <p>Although this is an user run site, we take privacy as a main concern. We offer different ways to use the radio, and different methods to prevent drive-by extraction of user data.</p>
      <p>By default, any unauthenticated API call or client has all the identifiable information removed from the response. A list of some of these actions, not complete:
        <ul>
          <li>Listener count does not contain any names and just number of guests.</li>
          <li>Song favorite details are removed from all data.</li>
          <li>Hashes, tags and paths are removed from all data.</li>
          <li>They do not get favorite broadcasts.</li>
          <li>They are not allowed to use any API method except the /events/basic WebSocket (which prunes this information), the /cover method (which shows them a cover), and /download rate-limited method (to use OoB player links).</li>
          <li>Users not authenticated via Satsuki on site will not be able to use miku commands.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>All connections to the site require SNI and a modern browser / client that supports TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3, and only ECDHE Forward Secrecy modern ciphers are enabled (with server-preferred order). Certificates are auto-renewed by LetsEncrypt (4096bits RSA currently), and secure connections are enforced via HSTS. DNSSEC is enabled on our domain and DANE TLSA records set. You are connecting directly to us. Security updates are installed automatically.</p>
      <p>All resources used on site / web are stored locally, and requests are not sent to any other servers.</p>
      <p>When you connect to the radio stream, you will be sending us your IP address (it's how the Internet works). We don't keep logs with any information that can identify the user behind the request (no URL query, no IPs, no Cookies), and these logs are not stored on disk. But don't trust us, use a VPN.</p>
      <p>You have the possibility of listening to the radio while unauthenticated. This means you are just a "guest", not someone with a nick. You are still able to use the #radio IRC channel or miku over PM, this will not give us any information about your connection to the radio site.</p>
      <p>When you enter #radio or use miku, you are letting us see your AnimeBytes username and class (you need to be auth'd via Satsuki to use commands). If you use one of your API keys on the web interface / stream link, this creates a link between IP <-> AnimeBytes user. While we do not store or show any IP information, this could be something you don't want to do.</p>
      <p>When you use the favorite features you are letting other users see your chosen nick in the songs you favorite, and allow searching for other songs you like. If you do not want this but still want to use this feature, we recommend you use a random made-up nick.</p>
      <p>If you want to delete all data stored for your account (nick, favorite list, API keys) you can contact us on the #radio channel. If you want to rename your nick, we can also help you there.</p>
      <p><b>TL;DR: Use a VPN, we don't want to know what your IP is. Do not authenticate on Web UI / stream and use just IRC control features if you don't trust us. Use a made-up nick if you don't want other users seeing what you like.</b></p>

      <h1 id="source">Source code</h1>
      <p>Most of the parts used to build this site were written by others originally, some were patched, others were written from scratch. Listed below are the distinct parts that compose the radio, and if able, a location with the currently available source code.</p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>radio-docker</b>: Merges all projects together in a single platform, and containerizes it via Docker and docker-compose. Used for testing and site itself in the future.
          <br/>Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/WeebDataHoarder/radio-docker" target="_blank">github.com/WeebDataHoarder/radio-docker</a>.</li>
        <li><b>radio-web</b>: Radio website. Though mainly static, Out of Band player has some extra PHP code to run the backend search and matching.
          <br/>Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/WeebDataHoarder/radio-web" target="_blank">github.com/WeebDataHoarder/radio-web</a>.</li>
        <li><b>stewdio-api</b>: Main music database, and API interaction system written in Python. Forked from original <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~minus/stewdio-api" target="_blank">stewdio-api</a>. Adds extra features (covers, database indexes, extra search, and others) and mainly removes user management.
          <br/>Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/WeebDataHoarder/stewdio-api" target="_blank">github.com/WeebDataHoarder/stewdio-api</a>.</li>
        <li><b>kawa</b>: Radio live streamer and queue management written in Rust. Fork with some changes from original.
          <br/>Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/WeebDataHoarder/kawa" target="_blank">github.com/WeebDataHoarder/kawa</a>.</li>
        <li><b>radio-matcher</b>: Metadata matcher and finder. Finds and collects metadata from other sources, and creates tags. All this is then pushed to main music database for normal use. Mainly a collection of PHP scripts and produced database.
          <br/>Source code is not available at this moment :(</li>
        <li><b>miku</b>: IRC bot. Handles user management, provides rich search and other more useful features. Mainly PHP.
          <br/>Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/WeebDataHoarder/radio-ircbot" target="_blank">github.com/WeebDataHoarder/radio-ircbot</a>.</li>
